ALIAS basics
	\c4========\c3GAME BASICS\c4========
	\c3Mafia Madness \c6(which may be referred to as '\c3MM\c6' for short) is a gamemode based on the classic game of mafia.
	\c6There are two basic teams (or more accurately, alignments) that seek to eliminate each other: the \c0Mafia \c6and the \c2Innocents\c6.
	\c6The \c2Innocents \c6do not know who the \c0Mafia \c6are, but the \c0Mafia\c6 know each other and work together to eliminate everyone else.
	\c6The \c2Innocents \c6work to eliminate all the \c0Mafia \c6through wit and observation.
	\c4Remember: Mafia Madness is about the \c2process of elimination\c4, not the \c0elimination itself\c4! The point is to figure it out, not murder randomly.
	\c6The game is divided into rounds, each round being independent, with an intermission DM period in between.
	\c6At the beginning of the round, the list of roles is generated, and every player is given a random role from that list.
	\c4When you receive your role, you will get an explanation in chat of how it works and how to use it! Pay attention!
	\c4If you're a \c0Mafia, \c4you will also receive a list of all other \c0Mafia \c4in the game. You can access this list again with \c3/maflist\c4.
	\c6If you're confused about a role, you can do \c3/describe \c7[ROLE INITIALS] \c6to get a description.
	\c6After a round is over, there will be a deathmatch period for admins to sort out any problems. Be patient! Games will resume eventually.
	\c4For more advanced game concepts, be sure to read the \c3Advanced \c4section!

ALIAS advanced
	\c4========\c3ADVANCED CONCEPTS\c4========
	\c4====\c3Day/Night Cycle\c4====
	\c6MM features a day/night cycle which governs certain game mechanics. Each round will start on the dawn of the first day.
	\c6Eventually, it will become night. During the night, everyone's avatars are black silhouettes. You can still see their name if you're close enough, though!
	\c6During the night, some special roles like the <color:1122CC>Cop \c6and the <color:2D1A4A>Abductor \c6can activate their abilities.
	\c6See the \c3Roles \c6section for more information on special roles.
	\c4====\c3Corpses and Dying\c4====
	\c6When a player dies, they will leave behind a corpse which can be examined and moved by other players.
	\c6You can pick up and throw corpses by right-clicking. Bring corpses you find to the gathering point as evidence!
	\c6If you activate (click on) a corpse, you will normally be able to see who the player was, their role, and the cause of death (Murder, Suicide, or Falling).
	\c6The role given on the corpse will be a name relating to the role's purpose and function. For instance, a normal innocent is "\c3upstanding citizen\c6."
	\c4If you're ever confused by a role name on a corpse, you can do \c3/corpseName \c7[CORPSE NAME] \c4for more information.
	\c6Dead players will go to the afterlife, where they can sit around, hit each other with swords, play pong, or spectate.
	\c4To toggle spectator mode in the afterlife, press the light key.
	\c4====\c3Local Chat\c4====
	\c6During rounds, MM has local chat. This means that not everyone will be able to hear you speak. There are four different chat 'levels.'
	\c6Normal chat will be in a medium range (about 64 studs in any direction). This level is common for players in any gathering place.
	\c6Starting your message with a ! in normal chat, or speaking in all capital letters, will make you shout, which has twice as long a range (about 128 studs).
	\c6Use shouting to talk to players away from the gathering spot or to make announcements. All shouted messages will be in all capital letters.
	\c6Using team chat will make you use low chat, which has a much shorter range (about sixteen studs), and does not go through walls.
	\c6Starting your message with a ! in low chat will make you whisper, which has a very short range and can normally only be heard by people directly next to you.
	\c6Low chat and whisper are best used to secretly talk with other players nearby and develop strategies or exchange information.
	\c4====\c3Miscellaneous\c4====
	\c6During a round, you can use the \c3/claim \c7[ROLE INITIALS] \c6command to claim that you are a certain role. Your name colour will change to indicate your claim.
	\c6Spectators can see what role you have claimed, and other players may question you about your claim.

ALIAS roles
	\c4========\c3SPECIAL ROLES\c4========
	\c6Mafia Madness features many special roles which function slightly differently.
	\c6Some have special abilities, and some are even on completely different teams (referred to as <color:808080>Unaligned \c6roles)!
	\c6It's important that you know about the special roles, as they can drastically change the course of a round.
	\c6Misunderstanding a role's function can cost you and your team the round, or get you killed!
	\c6There are too many special roles to list here, so you can get a list of them by doing \c3/listRoles\c6.
	\c4If, at any point, you need to know about a role, you can use \c3/describe \c7[ROLE INITIALS] \c4to get an explanation. (eg \c3/describe \c2I\c6)

ALIAS offenses
	\c4========\c3OFFENSES\c4========
	\c6Mafia Madness is a complex game, and it's important that everyone plays by the rules so everyone can have a good time.
	\c6Knowing what not to do is \c3of utmost importance\c6! If you mess up, you may cost your team the game, and you may be banned from the server!
	\c4These are things that are \c3against \c4the rules; note that administration is not necessarily limited to these rules:
	\c41. =Inno= \c6DO NOT kill someone without even the slightest provocation or reason to believe they're mafia.
	\c42. =Maf= \c6DO NOT kill any of your fellow Mafia members.
	\c4   2a. =Maf= \c6EXCEPTION: Doing so can be part of a clever ploy to prove yourself innocent.
	\c43. =All= \c6DO NOT make a deliberate attempt to cause your team to lose.
	\c4   3a. \c6Suiciding in any form (direct suicide, jumping to your death, using cute commands or drawing suspicion to yourself to be shot) falls under this category.
	\c44. =All= \c6DO NOT use any out-of-game method of communication to another player about a game in progress.
	\c45. =All= \c6DO NOT connect to the server with the same exact name as another player on the server.
	\c46. =Dead= \c6DO NOT deliberately attempt to mess up the Pong game in the Afterlife.
	\c4Type \c3/rules offenses examples \c4for examples of breaking the rules, and reasons why.

ALIAS offenses.examples
	\c4========\c3OFFENSE EXAMPLES\c4========
	\c6Here are some examples of breaking the rules (These aren't the only examples, though!)
	\c41. =Inno= \c6Seeing someone on the roof and shooting them instantly
	\c6   REASON: Just being on the roof alone is not a reason to believe someone is mafia!
	\c42. =Maf= \c6Deciding to shoot everyone on the roof and shooting your fellow mafia members too.
	\c6   REASON: Your fellow mafia members are essential! Shooting them does not help your team at all.
	\c43. =All= \c6As mafia, killing yourself when you spawn, or telling the Innocents who the mafia are.
	\c6   REASON: If you're mafia, you're mafia! Selling your team out or refusing to play is childish and ruins the game.
	\c44. =All= \c6Using IRC to tell an alive player what happened either after or before you died.
	\c6   REASON: IRC is not part of the game, and using it or another out-of-game communication like this will get you banned permanently!
	\c45. =All= \c6Letting a friend use the same AUTH key as you and connect to the server.
	\c6   REASON: Two people with the same name is incredibly confusing in-game, as names are the only reliable method of identification.
	\c6   (extra: it'll also mess up commands that require player names)
	\c46. =Dead= \c6Spam-clicking the red ramp that spawns a new pong.
	\c6   REASON: It's a pain to reset the pong game once it's messed up, and spamming it may cause people lag. Also, it's very annoying.

ALIAS customs
	\c4========\c3CUSTOMS\c4========
	\c6Customs are not hard rules, but usually they're what people will expect you to do.
	\c6Note that everything listed here is subject to extreme change as common strategies evolve.
	\c6This is simply a run-down of the metagame as of the last update of these rules.
	\c4====\c3Roof and Voting\c4====
	\c6The first thing anyone does in a round is make their way to the roof as fast as possible.
	\c6If you can't find your way to the roof, just look around until you find an upwards stairway, and never go down.
	\c6Once everyone is on the Roof, the typical strategy to find the mafia is to vote on who to kill or investigate.
	\c6A common voting strategy if the ventriloquist is present is to initiate a gun vote, where players vote by pointing guns.
	\c6If you don't vote on who to kill, the Mafia and the Abductor will slowly eliminate you regardless.
	\c6You should never, however, vote to kill the Cop, Paranoid Cop, or Fingerprint Expert.
	\c6Typically, you should avoid killing someone directly until a majority vote (majority is commonly determined by live players on the roof) has been reached.
	\c6Leaving the roof is a bad idea, as then people will suspect you of being mafia, and sometimes shoot you.
	\c6Unexpectedly shooting someone is a good way to get yourself killed.  If you announce it first, you're more likely to survive.
	\c6The Mafia should attempt to infiltrate the roof subtly, and manipulate the voting.
	\c4====\c3Mafia Duties\c4====
	\c6Each special member of the Mafia has their own duty to perform in the game.
	\c6The Abductor's duty is to eliminate very dangerous roles like the Cop or Fingerprint Expert.
	\c6The Ventriloquist's duty is to confuse the innocents about the Cop, manipulate the vote, and cause split-second kills.
	\c6The Godfather's duty is to unite the mafia with a shared strategy.
	\c6The Crazy's duty is to be a loose cannon, operating below-roof and silently disfiguring as many bodies as possible.
	\c6The Crazy is also important for making sure that the Fingerprint Expert can't find out who the Abductor is.
	\c4====\c3Dos and Don'ts\c4====
	\c6While on the roof, there are some things that if you do them, you might be shot instantly without voting.
	\c6Shooting someone without declaring it first or any votes having passed will obviously likely get you shot.
	\c6Throwing bodies off the roof, or taking bodies from the pile and carrying them will also get you shot.
	\c6When you find a body, you should report its' name and role, and bring it to the roof.
	\c6At night, while the Abductor is alive, don't run too close to someone, or people might get suspicious.
	\c6Pulling out a gun for no reason or shooting at something for no reason will most likely get you shot.
	\c6Finally, disguising yourself as a body (avatar entirely red, default blocko) is very suspicious and might get you shot.
